      <h1>How Resonance works</h1>
      <p class="how-lead">
        Resonance helps you discover and evaluate research — from a single query to ranked papers and AI‑debated verdicts.

        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
          Researchers, investors, and builders are drowning in new papers. Resonance surfaces the ideas that matter:
          we search across arXiv, bioRxiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, and the open web; we rank by relevance;
          then our AI agents debate each paper and give you a clear verdict and confidence score. You spend less time
          filtering and more time building.
        </p>

        <h2>In Brief</h2>
        <ol class="how-steps">
          <li><strong>You ask</strong> — Enter a research direction or question (e.g. “CRISPR gene editing improvements” or “mechanistic interpretability”). We optionally summarize long queries into a short search topic.</li>
          <li><strong>We scrape</strong> — Our pipeline pulls papers from the sources you enable (arXiv, bioRxiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, internet search). You choose which sources in Preferences or on the dashboard.</li>
          <li><strong>We rank</strong> — An AI model filters and ranks candidates so we keep the top‑k most relevant papers.</li>
          <li><strong>We debate</strong> — For each paper, an AI agent argues for and against its importance over several rounds, then outputs a verdict (e.g. Promising, Interesting, Uncertain, Weak) and a confidence score.</li>
          <li><strong>You explore</strong> — Results appear in your dashboard. You can open a paper, read the verdict, chat with the agent about it, or add it to your Top Ideas mind map.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="how-section">
        <h2>How you can use it</h2>
        <ul class="how-list">
          <li><strong>Scout for breakthroughs</strong> — Keep a feed of promising papers in areas you care about.</li>
          <li><strong>Validate before investing</strong> — Use debate verdicts and confidence to triage what’s worth a deep read.</li>
          <li><strong>Build a mind map</strong> — Top Ideas turns your best findings into a connected map; you can move nodes and see how concepts relate.</li>
          <li><strong>Chat per paper</strong> — Ask follow‑up questions and get one‑liners and topicality scores to compare papers quickly.</li>

        <h2>In Depth</h2>
        <p> Welcome to <strong>Resonance</strong>, your research soundboard! 
          <br><br>
          Novel research is fundamental to societal, technological, and economic development on a global scale. Unfortunately, research papers are often highly decentralized, and there exist a scarcity of tools for consolidating and interacting deeply with existing research. A quick web-based search often only reveals highly cited, public research, often sweeping intriguing but underviewed research aside.
          <br><br>

          Whether it’s researchers looking for more comprehensive topical literature reviews, VCs looking for immediate, actionable areas of R&D investment, or anyone interested in deeply interacting with an idea of interest, Resonance streamlines the process of finding any and all intriguing research with the power of agentic and non-agentic AI. 
          <br><br>
          Users can search for a topic of interest in keyword or paragraph form. Resonance then scrapes the web, with the power of Browserbase and available APIs, for recent papers from a selection of arXiv, bioRxiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, and Google search which match your needs. Following intelligent filtering, key papers of research are selected and added to the user’s query dashboard. Our agentic system then reads through the full text of each paper to rate the level of topicality with the user’s request, flagging papers of special interest. The user can navigate to the research paper, or converse with another agent about the paper and its relevance to their needs.
          <br><br>
          We also have a custom mindmap, where your top researched ideas are dynamically and graphically represented, connected by strands of similarity, so users can effectively build upon previous research ideas, identifying key trends or underexplored areas. 
          <br><br>
          There’s more! Resonance can be connected to your phone via Poke, so rather than logging in via a web-based server, one can equivalently text the Poke agent their interests and specifications. Poke then automatically connects to the user’s dashboard, pursuing and reporting the relevant queries.
          <br><br>
          The world of research can be your soundboard with Resonance, the AI-integrated system for finding, filtering, and building upon global research.
